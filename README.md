# Fitness System


## Motivation
I was a strength and conditioning coach for about six years now, and three years ago (2015) I invented the features that can be found here along with my 'StrengthGap' project which is already finished but is still waiting to be released. Here I combined all of the useful calculators I invented during my work with clients with accounting system where any trainer can track his clients workouts and make CRUD operations by adding, deleting, updating clients and clients cards. This project is my first one man show coding experience so it not something I am proud of but is something to start with and share some of my strength conditioning tools.

## Features
### 1.Ideal Lean Body Mass Calculator
	One can find out how much his lean body mass should be depending on height and sex (wrist and ankle circumference are optional but increase precision). What LBM (lean body mass) stands for: it is every tissue in the body (including water) besides fat tissue. What this calculator will output is a single value or a range between two values (if you choose to put your wrist and ankle circumference and both are returning different values) and that will be your ideal lean body mass represented in kilograms. The value itself is what one can achieve naturally without using enhancing drugs. Statistically this calculator is 99% correct.
 ### 2. Body Weight Endurance Calculator
 #### (for Pull-ups and Dips)
### 3. Strength Endurance Calculator + 1RM 
	This calculator is again empirically invented with the main purpose to help trainee gain strength and strength-endurance (the second one stands out for high efficiency or hight performance over time). You need to put how much is your current best (on any strength basic exercise like squat, deadlift, etc.) in kilograms and how many reps you performed. Then you need to choose the amount of reps for the workout you are about to do, and then follow the values represented for each set. The idea of this protocol is to know exactly how much weight you should remove for every following set in order for the perceived exertion to be the same on each and every set.

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.
